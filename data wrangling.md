## Data wrangling/ Data Cleaning/ Data Remediation/ Data Munging
- also known as data cleaning, data remediation, or data munging, refers to a variety of processes designed to transform raw data into more readily used formats. The exact methods differ from project to project depending on the data you’re leveraging and the goal you’re trying to achieve. 

Some examples of data wrangling techniques include:

- Merging multiple data sources into a single dataset for analysis
- Identifying gaps in data (for example, empty cells in a spreadsheet) and either filling or deleting them1
- Deleting data that’s either unnecessary or irrelevant to the project you’re working on
- Identifying extreme outliers in data and either explaining the discrepancies or removing them so that analysis can take place

Data wrangling can be a manual or automated process. In scenarios where datasets are exceptionally large, automated data cleaning becomes a necessity. In organizations that employ a full data team, a data scientist or other team member is typically responsible for data wrangling. In smaller organizations, non-data professionals are often responsible for cleaning their data before leveraging it

Automating data wrangling is a complex process that involves several steps and can be achieved using various software tools. Here are some general steps that can be followed to automate data wrangling:

1. **Data collection**: The first step in automating data wrangling is to collect the data from various sources. This can be done using tools like web scrapers, APIs, or by importing data from files or databases.
2. **Data cleaning**: Once the data has been collected, it needs to be cleaned to remove any errors or inconsistencies. This can involve tasks like removing duplicate records, filling in missing values, or converting data types.
3. **Data transformation**: After the data has been cleaned, it may need to be transformed into a format that is suitable for analysis. This can involve tasks like aggregating data, normalizing values, or creating new features.
4. **Automation**: The final step in automating data wrangling is to set up a system that can automatically perform the above steps on a regular basis. This can involve using tools like cron jobs or workflow automation software to schedule and run the data wrangling process.

There are many software tools available that can help automate the data wrangling process. Some popular options include:
- **Pandas**: Pandas is a Python library that provides powerful data manipulation and analysis capabilities. It can be used to perform tasks like data cleaning and transformation.
- **OpenRefine**: OpenRefine is a tool for working with messy data. It allows you to clean and transform data using a graphical user interface¹.
- **Talend**: Talend is a data integration platform that provides tools for collecting, cleaning, and transforming data. It allows you to build and automate complex data pipelines.
