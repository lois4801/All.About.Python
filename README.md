### What is Data Wrangling?
- Data wrangling, also referred to as data munging, is the process of converting and mapping data from one raw format into another. The purpose of this is to prepare the data in a way that makes it accessible for effective use further down the line. Not all data is created equal, therefore itâ€™s important to organize and transform your data in a way that can be easily accessed by others
- Benefits of Data Wrangling
Although data wrangling is an essential part of preparing your data for use, the process yields many benefits. Benefits include:

Enhances ease of access to data
Faster time to insights
Improved efficiency when it comes to data-driven decision making
